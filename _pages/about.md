excerpt: "We started Northern Widget as a way to share open-source
          environmental measurement technologies with the world.<br>
          <br>
          For us, this is a passion project, linked to our day jobs as scientists, engineers, educators, designers, and developers.<br>
          <br>
          **Our mission:** On-the-ground environmental measurements in as many places as possible, regardless of wealth or accessibility, in sufficient density to understand the Earth system.
          "
intro:
  - excerpt: "On June 6, 2012, a group of friends on St. Paul's east side gathered with a mission to build build hardware, firmware, and software to help anyone, anywhere, measure the environment around them. We are passionate about water resources, international development, scientific advances, and technology. Since that time, we have spent nights, weekends, and scattered pockets of time to build a suite of quality data loggers, sensors, and tools. All of our designs are open source, and our philosophy is first and foremost to improve global access to foundational environmental data."

## Sales

We are currently transitioning through the year 2020 from development to development + sales. Please be in contact if you are interested in purchasing anything, and we will let you know what is available. Costs are dependent on quantity and development maturity.

## Collaborations and thanks

Our open-source instrumentation research has benefited greatly from collaborations with the University of Minnesota, including:
* Andrew Wickert's *Surface Processes Instrumentation Lab*
* Senior Design programs in both Electrical and Mechanical Engineering

Significant financial support for our work is provided by the [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Hydrometry Support Facility (HydroHub)](https://hydrohub.wmo.int/en/home) as part of an ongoing project to develop telemetered data loggers and better water-level sensors for use in Bhutan and Afghanistan.
