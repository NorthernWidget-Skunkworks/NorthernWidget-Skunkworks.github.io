Includes:
* 3-axis MEMS accelerometer to measure laser orientation
  * No need to position the sensor looking straight down to measure level: can trigonometrically coorect
  * Will record whether the sensor has been disturbed
* Power management and filtering for high current during laser shots
* Failsafes to reset the LiDAR Lite when its firmware locks, thus isolating the rest of your system from a potential failure mode.
* Full instructions for enclosure and mounting
