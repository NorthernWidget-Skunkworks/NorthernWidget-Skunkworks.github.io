# Boards

## Longbow

*Convert a RS-485 signal from a sensor (can travel up to 1 km) to an I2C signal that a standard logger or Arduino can read.*

## Tally

*Counter that can debounce noisy signals (e.g., from reed switches) in analog circuitry. Good for anemometers and tipping-bucket rain gauges.*

## Raven

*High-gain current amplifier.*

## Instrumentation-Amp

*Variable-gain instrumentation amplifier, used by us with thermopile pyranometers.*

## Heptapod

*Screw terminals to connect additional sensors to the same bus.*
[<i class="fab fa-fw fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/NorthernWidget-Skunkworks/Project-Raven)

Connect 1 I2C connection, half-duplex RS-485 connection, or (with a design variant) full-duplex RS-485 connection to up to four connections.
Turns one connection into four connections, and 1+4 = Heptapod.

## Maxbotix-Helper

*Breaks out the pins on a MaxBotix ultrasonic rangefinder into easy-connect screw terminals for the data logger and temperature correction.*
